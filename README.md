# Numpy
Short writeup on Numpy
NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed.
NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.The array object in NumPy is called ndarray, it provides a lot of supporting functions that make working with ndarray very easy.Arrays are very frequently used in data science, where speed and resources are very important.
